## most important Redux actors
The store, the reducer and an action.

## The Redux principle
- The **state of applicaiton** is stored in an object tree within a single Redux **store**
- The only way to change the **state** is to emit an **action**, an object describing what happened.
- To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write **pure reducers**
